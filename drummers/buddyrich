Bernard "Buddy" Rich (September 30, 1917 â€“ April 2, 1987) was an American jazz drummer and bandleader.

Known for his virtuoso technique, power and speed,
Rich was billed as "the world's greatest drummer" during his career.
He performed with many bandleaders, most notably Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, Count Basie,
and led his own "Buddy Rich Big Band"

At age 11, he was performing as a bandleader.
He received no formal drum instruction and went so far as to claim that instruction would
only degrade his musical talent. He also never admitted to practicing,
claiming to play the drums only during performances[4] and was not known to read music.
